- **Day 1 : Recycling**
    
    > Q1. I would like to know how recycling is practiced in your country. 
    What do people specifically do ? Tell me how things are recycled.
    너희 나라에서 재활용이 어떻게 행해지고 있는지 알고 싶어. 사람들은 구체적으로 무엇을 하나요?재활용 방법을 알려주세요.
    > 
    
    In my country, a considerable amount of trash is recycled. Among the trash thrown away by classification, recyclable plastic and glass bottles are melted again and made into new items. Recently, there are new workshops that use recycled materials to craft, so you can experience various things. Recently, there was a workshop that I wanted to go to, and it was also a place to make new toys by carving out discarded toys. In addition, brands that make and sell bags with waste banners are also gaining popularity. I've looked for that bag because I wanted to buy it.
    
    > Q2. Recycling is a common practice. Tell me about all the different kinds of things that you recycle.
    재활용은 흔한 관행이에요. 당신이 재활용하는 모든 다른 종류의 것들에 대해 말해주세요.
    > 
    
    When I buy shoes, I don't throw away the box that comes packed together. It's very useful when organizing things in the warehouse, because most of them are similar and angular. Also It's a box for shoes, it's especially useful when you organize and store shoes that you don't wear often. If you put a name tag in front of the box and store it, it's more convenient because you can find it at once without opening it one by one.
    
    > Q3. Problems sometimes occur when recycling. Perhaps, the pick-up service did not come as planned. Or the items were too big for the containers. Tell me about something memorable related to recycling.
    재활용 시 문제가 발생하기도 한다. 픽업 서비스가 계획대로 되지 않았을 수도 있다. 아니면 그 물건들이 컨테이너에 비해 너무 컸을 수도 있다. 재활용과 관련하여 기억에 남을 만한 것에 대해 말해 주세요.
    > 
    
    I didn't throw away the delivery container, but planted a flowerpot in this container. At first, I thought there was enough space because the size of the flower was small, but as the flower gradually grew, the roots became wider. Eventually, the recycled pot was not suitable for holding the flower, and then the roots came out through the recyclables. It was memorable because I had a hard time in the process of transferring the roots to another pot.
    
    > Q4. [재활용 관련 이슈] Are there any issues or problems regarding recycling? have you seen any news related to recyling recnetly? what was it about? give me all the dtails about any issues on recyling.
    > 
    
    With the increasing use of courier services, I've recently heard that box tape is gradually changing to paper tape. Paper boxes for delivery purposes can only be recycled as paper materials by removing the wrapped tape, which is often not removed. For this reason, it is said that the material of the wrapping tape is changed to paper so that it can be recycled without separating it. I actually looked up related articles when I saw that the packages I recently received were wrapped in paper tape. After using it, it was comfortable because it was strong and easy to recycle.
    
- **Day 2 : Music**
    
    > **Q1. Describe the kind of music you enjoy listening to. Tell me your favorite band, composer, or musician.** 즐겨 듣는 음악 종류를 묘사하세요. 좋아하는 밴드, 작곡가 혹은 음악가를 말해보세요.
    > 
    
    사실, 나는 기분에 따라 다양한 장르의 음악을 들어. 감정적이고 차분한 상태일 때는 발라드를 듣고, 활동적이고 싶을땐 밴드음악이나 힙합을 듣는 편이야. 방금전까지 듣고 있던 노래는 발라드야. 발라드는 마음이 복잡할때 잠시 가라앉히고 정리하는 시간을 갖기에 큰 도움이 돼. 나를 대신해서 감정을 표출해주는 느낌이거든. 나는 그래서 선우정아를 좋아해. 감정적으로 호소하듯이 노래를 부르다 보니, 그녀의 가사가 더욱 나의 마음에 와닿게 돼.
    
    I listen to various genres of music depending on my mood. When I'm emotional and calm, I listen to ballads, and when I want to be active, I listen to band music or hip-hop. I was listening to ballad songs just now. Ballads are very helpful to calm down and organize my mind when it's complicated. It feels like expressing my emotions on behalf of me. That's why I like Sunwoo Jung-ah. As she sings emotionally, her lyrics touch my heart more.
    
    > **Q2. When did you first become interested in music? What kind of music did you like at first? Tell me how your interest in music has changed since you were young.**

    중학생때부터 노래를 찾아듣기 시작했었어. 주변 친구들이 아이돌에 관심을 가지기 시작하면서 아이돌들이 나오는 음악방송을 꾸준히 챙겨봤거든. 그러면서 자연스럽게 방송에서 나왔던 k-pop을 찾아들었어. 그때부터 고등학생때까진 주로 K-pop을 즐겨들었어. 성인이 된 후론 기숙사에 살게 되면서 TV를 잘 안보게 되어서, 우연히 듣게된 노래가 좋으면 그 가수가 부른 다른 노래를 찾아듣게 되었어. 그러다보니 특정 가수의 노래만 많이 찾아 들었어.
    
    I started listening to K-pop when I was in middle school. As my friends became interested in idols, I watched music shows with idols. And I naturally listened to the k-pop that came out on the show. I usually listened to this until high school. After I became an adult, Because I lived in a dormitory, I couldn't watch TV often. So When I found my favorite song, I found another song that the singer sang. Finally I only listened to certain singers' songs a lot.
    
    > **Q3. You want to buy an MP3 player. Friend is knowledgeable about this. Contact him and ask him some information about his MP3 purchase.**
    당신이 MP3 플레이어를 구매하려고 합니다. 친구가 이에 대해 지식이 풍부합니다. 그 친구에게 연락해서 MP3구매에 대해 필요한 정보를 몇 가지 질문하세요.

    안녕? 요즘 잘 지내고 있지? 혹시 지금 전화할 시간 돼? 다른게 아니고, 내가 이번에 새로나온 MP3 플레이어에 관심이 생겼는데 궁금한게 생겨서 너한테 물어보고 싶었어. 네가 이걸 이미 사서 쓰고있다고 들었거든. 그것의 음질은 어떤것 같아? 이전 버전이랑 별 차이가 없다는 얘기를 들었거든. 이번에 학생 할인을 해 준다는 얘기를 들었는데 너도 이 할인을 받고 샀니?  주변에서 이걸 쓰고있는 사람이 너밖에 없어서 이렇게 물어봐.
    
    Hi. How are you doing? Do you happen to have time to call now? It's nothing else, I'm interested in the new MP3 player, but I wanted to ask you something because I'm curious about it. I heard you've already bought this and used it. What do you think about its sound quality? I heard there's no difference from the previous version. I heard that there's a student discount, did you buy it with this? You're the only one who's using this, so I'm asking to you.
    
    > **Q4. Describe some new technological advances, such as electronic devices, that music lovers are interested in these days. What do they usually talk about? Explain some of their favorite new products and why.**
    요즘 음악을 즐기는 사람들이 관심을 갖고 있는 전자기기 같은 새로운 기술적 발전 몇 가지를 설명해보세요. 그들은 주로 무엇에 대한 이야기를 하나요? 그들이 좋아하는 신제품 몇 가지와 이유를 설명하세요.
    > 
    
    무선 이어폰이 출시되기 시작하면서, 대다수의 사람들은 이전에 사용하던 유선이어폰을 더이상 사용하지 않게되었어. 선이 없다보니 움직이는데 엄청 자유로워졌거든. 사람들이 많이 사용하는 만큼 많은 수의 무선이어폰이 출시되었는데, 그 중 apple사에서 출시한 air pot의 가장 최신 상품이 인기가 많은거 같아. 이어폰을 끼면 외부 소리가 잘 들리지 않아서 옆사람과 대화할땐 벗어야 하는 경우가 많은데, 불필요하게 벗지 않아도 자연스레 대화가 가능하도록 좋은 기술이 들어가 있거든.
    
    With the launch of wireless earphones, most people no longer use their previous wired earphones. There's no wire, so it's really free to move. A large number of wireless earphones have been released as many people use it, and among them, the latest product of the AirPods is popular. You often have to take it off while you talk to the person next to you. because you can't hear the outside sound well. But it has good technology so that you can talk naturally without taking it off unnecessarily.
    
- **Day 3 : Jogging**

    The place where I most like to go jogging is a river near by my house. I like the sound of water, so I visit there often. The thing that make this place special is that the track is made of a spongy. So it is the best place to jog in sneakers. ****Sometimes I can greet various dogs who came out for a walk, and also meet otters who live in the river if I am lucky. I like animals, so I liked this part better. Except after meal time, it is often quiet. So it is good to walk comfortably without a mask.

It's easy to start, so I think it's good to do it for a long time. And I can walk outdoors feeling the wind, so I can evoke my mood by jogging when I am mentally confused.

    When I was in high school, sitting most of the time, I didn't have time to move my body. I ended up losing my stamina. I thought I should do the least amount of exercise, so I started walking on the school playground after dinner. At first, I was tired even if I walked a little bit. But after jogging steadily every day, I got stronger, so I didn't get tired even if I kept walking until just before class. Since then, walking has become a habit, so I think I've been jogging steadily. Even if I do other exercises, feel like moved my body properly when I eventually jogged.

    When I went to college, I remember taking a walk in the Nakdonggang River next to the school the most. The river is so beautiful that I get more excited when I walk alone while listening to music. I usually walked alone, but on good days, I talked about various things while walking with my friend. It was nice to be able to get closer to each other because we were able to talk deeply while walking. I can't go there as often as I did back then, but sometimes I miss it.

    In any season, I tend to wear layers of clothes. My body temperature is low when I start walking, but as I walk, I get hot and take off my clothes. It's windy outside, so I tend to wear it like this. For pants, I tend to wear loose training pants or leggings. Leggings, especially, are tight to the body, so it's better to run because they're active.

    > 
    
    Actually, I prefer to rest at home alone. So I didn't think about calling someone, but if I had to be with someone, it would be my local friends. They know me the longest, so we can be comfortable with each other. It's good to know each other a lot so we can talk about deep things a lot.

    Recently, I went to Busan to see the sea. I met my friends who lived there, and I got accommodation and grilled meat. I often went near the sea and looked around a lot. During the day, I took off my shoes and walked around the beach. I loved the sound of the waves and the cool sea. I think I could have been happier because everyone who was there looked happy.

    Whether it's a student or a person with a job, we're constantly doing what we're given. In order to keep doing what we're doing now, I think we need to stop it in the middle and take a break.

    Do you know Marvel? I like movies made by Marvel. I like SF genre movies, so it's fun to watch movies that have such a world view. All the heroes in these movie are three-dimensional and alive.

    Honestly, I don't have a particular favorite movie theater. Since most movie theaters are chain stores, they are well managed. I just check to see if it's a place where I can watch a movie that I want. And also, Make sure my favorite seat is empty in the movie theater. The center seat in the third or fourth row from the back is the best to watch the movie. Then I don't have to bend my neck. Recently, I watched Dr. Strange on the spot. As expected, it was so fun and comfortable.
    
    > **Q3. What is your routine when you going to the theater? What do you do before the movie and after? Please describe your routine in as much detail as possible.** 영화관에 갔을 때 행동 패턴(루틴)은 어떻게 되나요? 영화를 보기 전과 후에 무엇을 하나요? 당신의 루틴을 가능한 자세히 말해주세요.

    Before entering the movie theater, I tend to buy popcorn and coke if possible. I think I can enjoy the mood of the movie theater when I eat popcorn. I eat almost of it at the beginning of the movie, and then eat less when I focus on the movie. After the movie is over, I search the Internet to find if there are any cookie scenes of this movie before I go out. And if there are, make sure to watch it. While waiting, talk about review with the person who with me.
    
    > **Q4. Talk about the movie that you remember the best. What was it? Who was in the movie? How does it feel when you were watching it?** 가장 기억에 남는 영화를 말해주세요. 무엇이었나요? 누가 영화에 나왔나요? 그 영화를 볼 때 어떤 기분이었나요?
    > 
    
    Do you know Marvel? I like movies made by Marvel. So the most impressive movie for me is "End-Game”. All the heroes who appeared in Marvel's movies over the years came out. And the death of some heroes marked a major change in the movie's worldview. I still can't forget the shock. I was really sad to think that I could no longer see my favorite heroes. After watching the movie, it lingered for a long time. Not only me, but everyone who liked the movie was so sensitive about the spoiler at the time.
    
    > **Q5. How has your interest in movies changed over the last few years? What kind of movies did you like in the past? What about now?** 시간이 지나면서 당신의 영화 취향은 어떻게 변화하였습니까? 과거에는 어떤 영화를 좋아했나요? 지금은 어떤가요?
    > 
    
    I used to watch war movies and action movies. My family loved that kind of movie. But now I know I don't really like movies like that. Seeing someone get hit and hurt, it's hard because I feel like I'm getting hurt. However, in recent years, I’ve taken to watching more SF movies. It's a movie that's not realistic, so it's more new and interesting. There are many visually rich things to enjoy, so I'm getting hooked while watching the movie.

### 1) 영화보기

> **Q1. [가장 좋아하는 영화] 
You indicated in the survey that you enjoy watching movies. What is your favorite movie? Give me a description with lots of details.**
> 

Do you know Marvel? I like movies made by Marvel. I like SF genre movies, so it's fun to watch movies that have such a world view. All the heroes in these movie are three-dimensional and alive. Each person becomes the main character and leads their story. When heroes from different movies come out together, I feel so thrilled. Now, I know why children like heroes.

> **Q2. [가장 좋아하는 영화관 또는 공연장]
Which theater or auditorium do you like the most? What do you like about there? Where is it located? Tell me about the movie you have watched at this venue.**

Honestly, I don't have a particular favorite movie theater. Since most movie theaters are chain stores, they are well managed. I just check to see if it's a place where I can watch a movie that I want. And also, Make sure my favorite seat is empty in the movie theater. The center seat in the third or fourth row from the back is the best to watch the movie. Then I don't have to bend my neck. Recently, I watched Dr. Strange on the spot. As expected, it was so fun and comfortable.

> **Q3. [영화 보기 전후 루틴]
What is your routine when you going to the theater? What do you do before the movie and after? Please describe your routine in as much detail as possible.**

Before entering the movie theater, I tend to buy popcorn and coke if possible. I think I can enjoy the mood of the movie theater when I eat popcorn. I eat almost of it at the beginning of the movie, and then eat less when I focus on the movie. After the movie is over, I search the Internet to find if there are any cookie scenes of this movie before I go out. And if there are, make sure to watch it. While waiting, talk about review with the person who with me.

> **Q4. [가장 기억에 남는 영화] 
Talk about the movie that you remember the best. What was it? Who was in the movie? How does it feel when you were watching it?**
> 

Do you know Marvel? I like movies made by Marvel. So the most impressive movie for me is "End-Game”. All the heroes who appeared in Marvel's movies over the years came out. And the death of some heroes marked a major change in the movie's worldview. I still can't forget the shock. I was really sad to think that I could no longer see my favorite heroes. After watching the movie, it lingered for a long time. Not only me, but everyone who liked the movie was so sensitive about the spoiler at the time.

> **Q5. [영화 취향의 변화사]
How has your interest in movies changed over the last few years? What kind of movies did you like in the past? What about now?**
> 

I used to watch war movies and action movies. My family loved that kind of movie. But now I know I don't really like movies like that. Seeing someone get hit and hurt, it's hard because I feel like I'm getting hurt. However, in recent years, I’ve taken to watching more SF movies. It's a movie that's not realistic, so it's more new and interesting. There are many visually rich things to enjoy, so I'm getting hooked while watching the movie.

So it is the best place to jog in sneakers. ****Sometimes I can greet various dogs who came out for a walk, and also meet otters who live in the river if I am lucky. I like animals, so I liked this part better. Except after meal time, it is often quiet. So it is good to walk comfortably without a mask.

I think it's best that anyone can jog with just two legs. Compared to other sports, you don't need special equipment, so it's easy to start anytime, anywhere.

When I was in high school, sitting most of the time, I didn't have time to move my body. I ended up losing my stamina. I thought I should do the least amount of exercise, so I started walking on the school playground after dinner. At first, I was tired even if I walked a little bit. But after jogging steadily every day, I got stronger, so I didn't get tired even if I kept walking until just before class. Since then, walking has become a habit, so I think I've been jogging steadily. Even if I do other exercises, feel like moved my body properly when I eventually jogged.

In my country, a considerable amount of trash is recycled. Among the trash thrown away by classification, recyclable plastic and glass bottles are melted again and made into new items. Recently, there are new workshops that use recycled materials to craft, so you can experience various things.

With the increasing use of courier services, I've recently heard that box tape is gradually changing to paper tape. Paper boxes for delivery purposes can only be recycled as paper materials by removing the wrapped tape, which is often not removed. For this reason, it is said that the material of the wrapping tape is changed to paper so that it can be recycled without separating it. I actually looked up related articles when I saw that the packages I recently received were wrapped in paper tape. After using it, it was comfortable because it was strong and easy to recycle.
